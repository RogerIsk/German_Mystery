The employment agency asks you to submit the same document for the 10th time - so you go to the office in a rage to resolve the matter once and for all.

When you arrive at the office, you find yourself standing in an empty hall with not a soul around and wonder where your point of contact might be. You think about where you are most likely to find someone who can help you with your matter.
