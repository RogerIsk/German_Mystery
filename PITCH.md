#story starts here:

The employment agency asks you to submit the same document for the 10th time - so you go to the office in a rage to resolve the matter once and for all.

When you arrive at the office, you find yourself standing in an empty hall with not a soul around and wonder where your point of contact might be. You think about where you are most likely to find someone who can help you with your matter.
There are 3 options available to you:

1. you take the elevator
2. you take the stairs
3. you were in the hall until you met a member of staff


1. you take the elevator:

What will you do:
1.  wait for the elevator
2.  you will use the stairs
